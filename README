INTRODUCTION:

This tool generates code comments automatically by 
analyzing existing software repositories. 
It applies code clone detection techniques to discover 
similar code segments and use the comments from some code segments 
to describe the other similar code segments. 

HOW TO RUN:

1.
Configure "config.xml"'s <database> tag
with the appropriate folder path.
The folders should contain Java source code files.

Code inside the <database> tag represents the database.
CloCom will extract code comments from this folder for
the code inside the <project> folder.

Leave the matchMode to 1 for fullmesh matching.

2. 

'make' to compile.

2. 
Run the shell script with the config file as the first input argument.

./cloneDigger.sh config.xml
